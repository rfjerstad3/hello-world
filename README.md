First test project on GitHub

I've heard a lot about GitHub and using Git for projects but where I worked we stuck with Visual Studio and TFS.  There were other groups that had started using GitHub and were very happy with it.  I thought it was time to check it out and see for myself just what this tool was capable of.

So far I like the organization, things seem pretty natural and obvious which is good - I've found a lot of tools tend to over engineer their products and you spend a lot of time hunting for or trying to memorize where things are at.
